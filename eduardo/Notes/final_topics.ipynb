    "\n",
    "2. 2023 Midterm 1 Q4 (Regularization in MV optimization):\n",
    "\n",
    "- No direct repeat in 2024 Midterm 1.\n",

    "3. 2024 Midterm 1 Q2 (Including/excluding intercepts in factor models):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not directly linked to 2023 Midterm 1, but conceptually similar to 2023 Final Q1 discussing LFPM fit via cross-sectional and time-series tests.\n",

    "1. 2023 Midterm 2 Q3 (Sharpe ratio relation in CAPM):\n",
    "\n",
    "- No direct repeat in 2024 Midterm 2 but 2024 Q1.3 discusses cumulative return certainty, which relates to the time horizon and variance scaling with CAPM assumptions.\n",
    "- Prediction: Sharpe ratios or risk-return measures, especially tied to time horizons or CAPM extensions, may appear on the 2024 Final Exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 2023 Midterm 2 Q5 (Momentum strategy risks and returns):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Directly mirrored in 2024 Midterm 2 Q1.5, comparing cryptocurrency and US equity momentum strategies.\n",
    "- Prediction: Momentum strategies and their risk profiles, particularly in alternative markets, could feature on the 2024 Final Exam, expanding the application of momentum to other assets or scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 2023 Midterm 2 Q1/Q2 (Factor models and pricing):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concepts reappear in 2024 Midterm 2 Q1.1 (size factor decrease) and Q1.2 (MAE and factor addition).\n",
    "- Prediction: Expect factor model-related questions, potentially linked to testing methods (time-series or cross-sectional) or specific factors like size (SMB), as seen in 2023 Final Q1 and Q2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Predictions for 2024 Final Exam\n",
    "Based on recurring themes from 2023 Final Exam, the following topics are likely candidates for the 2024 Final Exam:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean-Variance Optimization and Regularization:\n",
    "- Stability of weights, portfolio diversification, TIPS' impact (MV optimization under unique conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Factor Models:\n",
    "- Cross-sectional vs. time-series tests, inclusion/exclusion of factors (like size, momentum, or new pricing factors).\n",
    "- LFPM errors or APT applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Momentum Strategies:\n",
    "- Comparison of momentum implementation in different markets (cryptocurrencies, US equities).\n",
    "- Risk and return profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CAPM and Sharpe Ratios:\n",
