    "# Linear Factor Pricing Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind factor investing is that a standard diversification strategy emphasizing asset classes may lack optimal exposure to factors known to yield high average returns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, since diversification involves managing the correlation structure across investments, factor investing can enhance diversification by providing a richer set of cross-correlations, better managing the risk and return of a portfolio across market cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smart Beta ETFs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:**\n",
    "- A smart beta ETF is a type of exchange-traded fund that uses alternative index construction rules to traditional market capitalization-based indices.\n",
    "- The strategy is to use factor models to systematically select, weight, and rebalance stocks in the ETF to add value by tilting its exposure to specific risk premia.\n",
    "- Smart beta portfolios are constructed such that the emphasis is weighting stocks in these portfolios not on the traditional measure of market capitalization, but by incorporating into their weighting scheme some aspect of a security’s fundamental value, such as a stock’s B/M ratio, profitability, or a characteristic of the security’s performance, such as a stock’s momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart beta ETFs are considered a combination of passive and active investing:\n",
    "- They are **passive** because they passively mimic what are termed **factor indexes** and hence do not require any input from a portfolio manager.\n",
    "- They are **active** because their weights deviate from standard market capitalization weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Lower fees than active management and hedge funds.\n",
    "- Transparent and rules-based.\n",
    "- Diversified and liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- Do not capture the pure factors because ETFs are not allowed to short stocks, so the long-only portfolios end up having high correlation with the market (not \"near-zero\" market beta).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Betas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market Beta:** The sensitivity of a stock's return to the market return.\n",
    "- **Size Beta:** The sensitivity of a stock's return to the size factor.\n",
    "- **Value Beta:** The sensitivity of a stock's return to the value factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get each of those betas by running a regression of the stock's return on the factors' return.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The factors don't have to have a trend over time if the market is trending over time, because they are hedged long-short portfolios: they could go up a lot or down a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "What matters is the security's **beta** matters, not its measure of the **characteristic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *The premium comes if the stock \"acts like\" the factor, not if the stock \"has\" the characteristic.*\n",
    "- So what does the FF model expect of a stock with high B/M yet low correlation to other high B/M stocks?\n",
    "- **Beta** earns premium—not the stock’s characteristic.\n",
    "- This is one difference between FF \"value\" investing and Buffett-Graham \"value\" investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Premium:\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk premium is the expected excess return of a factor, that it, the rewardfor holding an specific factor risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Regression:**\n",
    "- As with CAPM, we run a time series regression on the Linear Factor Decomposition.\n",
    "    - Unlike heding  or replication, we don't care about the R-squared of the regression here.\n",
    "    - We care about the $alphas$. If the $alphas$ are statistically different than zero, then we have a pricing error.\n",
    "    - Statistical significance through chi-squared test of alphas.\n",
    "    - The $alphas$ are the pricing errors, and they should be zero if the model is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross Sectional Regression:**\n",
    "- Also as with CAPM, run a regression of the cross section of stock returns on the factor betas\n",
    "- Look at the R-squared of the regression. The higher the R-squared, the better the model.\n",
    "- The error term here is the residual return, which is the return that is not explained by the factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tangency Portfolio:**\n",
    "- Calculate the tangency portfolio, which is the portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.\n",
    "- If the tangency portfolio does not relevant weights on some of the factors, then it means that that factor is unimportant relative to the others and could be dropped.\n",

    "Many other measures of value are based on some cash-flow or accounting value per market price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Earnings-price** is a popular metric beyond value portfolios. Like B/M, the E/P ratio is accounting value per market valuation.\n",
    "- **EBITDA-price** is similar, but uses an accounting measure of profit that ignores taxes, financing, and depreciation.\n",
    "- **Dividend-price** uses common dividends, but is less useful for individual firms as many have no dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other measures exist, with competing claims to being a special/better measure of \"value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Value vs. Growth Stocks:\n",
    "The labels \"growth\" and \"value\" are widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historically, value stocks have delivered higher average returns.\n",
    "- So-called \"value\" investors try to take advantage of this by looking for stocks with low market price per fundamental or per cash-flow.\n",
    "- Much research has been done to try to explain this difference of returns and whether it is reflective of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth Stocks:**\n",
    "Stocks trading at a low price relative to a measure of fundamental value such as book equity.\n",
    "- It doesn't mean they have actually grown a lot in the past. It means that it doesn't have much accounting value per stock.\n",
    "- The name comes from the implication that investors must be expecting the company to grow a lot in the future to justify paying a high price for the stock relative to its book value (low book to market ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value Stocks:**\n",
    "- High book-to-market ratio companies are generally less profitable and are relatively distressed, so these firms are riskier and have a higher average return.\n",
