    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Pricing Model is a model that try to explain the *long-run expected excess return (expected return above the risk-free rate)* of an asset as a linear function of its exposure (beta) to certain risk factors, each having an expected excess returns associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Factor Pricing Model*:\n",
    "- Explains how expected excess returns vary accross assets (not how they vary across time).\n",
    "- Is all about **expected** excess returns (not realized returns).\n",
    "- Models the long-term expected returns of an asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"risk premium\"** is the expected excess return of a factor due to the risk it represents.\n",
    "- *The risk premium of an asset is proportional to the risk premium of the factors it is exposed to.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*It Very different from Linear Factor Decomposition*, which is about realized returns and how they vary across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Premium (Rational vs. Behavioral)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rational Risk Premium: The expected excess return of a factor due to the risk it represents.\n",
    "- Behavioral Risk Premium: The expected excess return of a factor due to the mispricing of the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is still a lot of debate nowadays whether it's in compensation for risk or whether the risk premium might just be due to markets being irrational (ex. bubbles and trends).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beta\n",
    "\n",
    "The **beta** of an asset with respect to a factor is the sensitivity of the asset's expected excess return to the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We got those betas from the Linear Factor Decomposition (time-series regression) and we are using them to predict the expected excess return of the asset.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- A negative market beta mean that the asset is expected to have a lower return when the market goes up (negative mean excess return). Ex.: put options.\n",
    "- The betas are not typical time series regression betas (like in a Linear Factor Decomposition), because if they were, the equation E[r_i] = beta_i,m * E[r_m] would actually be E[r_t] = alpha + beta_m,t * E[r_m,t] + epsilon_t\n",
    "- Whatever happens this month (ex. stock goes down while the market goes up), it doesn't matter. This Factor Pricing Models are a theory about expected long-term average excess returns.\n",
    "- Different than Linear Factor Decomposition, where the the left and right hand side are about realized returns. Here we are talking about expected excess returns.\n",
    "    - In a Linear Factor Decomposition, the beats means that, on average, when the market goes up by 1%, the asset goes up by beta_i,m %.\n",

    "## CAPM\n",
    "\n",
    "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a linear factor model that relates the expected excess return of an asset to its beta with the market portfolio and the market risk premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAPM identifies the **market portfolio** as the tangency portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The market portfolio is the value-weighted portfolio of all available assets.\n",
    "- It should include every type of asset, including non-traded assets.\n",
    "- In practice, a broad equity index is typically used.\n",
    "- *In practice, we use a broad equity index, like SPY or Russell 1000.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAPM is about **expected** returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The expected return of any asset is given as a function of two market statistics: the risk-free rate and the market risk premium.\n",
    "- The coefficient is determined by a regression. \n",
    "- The theory does not say anything about how the risk-free rate or market risk premium are given: it is a **relative pricing formula**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Market beta is the only risk associated to higher average returns:*\n",
    "- No other characteristics of the asset command a higher expected excess return returns from investors\n",
    "- **Beyond how it affects market beta, CAPM says volatility, skewness, and other covariances do not matter** for determining risk premia.\n",
    "- Idiosyncratic risks have such a negligible effect on the portfolio that in the limit it becomes meaningless  (what matters is its covariance with the rest of the portfolio).\n",
    "- The only thing that matters is the beta.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First method: If returns have a joint normal distribution...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The mean and variance of returns are sufficient statistics for the return distribution.\n",
    "2. Thus, every investor holds a portfolio on the MV frontier.\n",
    "3. Everyone holds a combination of the tangency portfolio and the risk-free rate.\n",
    "4. Then aggregating across investors, the market portfolio of all investments is equal to the tangency portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "1. Returns are not jointly normal nor iid.\n",
    "2. Investors ae not each holding a portfolio on the MV frontier.\n",
    "3. Then. in reality, the market portfolio is not the tangency portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Method: Don’t assume the returns are jointly normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is another way of assuming all investors choose MV portfolios (only care about mean and variance of return).\n",
    "- But now it is not because mean and variance are sufficient statistics of the return distribution, but rather that they are sufficient statistics of investor objectives.\n",
    "- So one derivation of the CAPM is about return distribution, while the other is about investor behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "- Investors do not all hold MV portfolios, some could be holding inefficient portfolios based on their individual preferences or what makes them feel good.\n",
