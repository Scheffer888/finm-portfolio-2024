    "# Factor Pricing Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Pricing Model is a model that try to explain the *long-run expected excess return (expected return above the risk-free rate)* of an asset as a linear function of its exposure (beta) to certain risk factors, each having an expected excess returns associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Factor Pricing Model*:\n",
    "- Explains how expected excess returns vary accross assets (not how they vary across time).\n",
    "- Is all about **expected** excess returns (not realized returns).\n",
    "- Models the long-term expected returns of an asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"risk premium\"** is the expected excess return of a factor due to the risk it represents.\n",
    "- *The risk premium of an asset is proportional to the risk premium of the factors it is exposed to.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*It Very different from Linear Factor Decomposition*, which is about realized returns and how they vary across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind factor investing is that a standard diversification strategy emphasizing asset classes may lack optimal exposure to factors known to yield high average returns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, since diversification involves managing the correlation structure across investments, factor investing can enhance diversification by providing a richer set of cross-correlations, better managing the risk and return of a portfolio across market cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Risk Premium (Rational vs. Behavioral)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rational Risk Premium: The expected excess return of a factor due to the risk it represents.\n",
    "- Behavioral Risk Premium: The expected excess return of a factor due to the mispricing of the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is still a lot of debate nowadays whether it's in compensation for risk or whether the risk premium might just be due to markets being irrational (ex. bubbles and trends).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The risk premium is the expected excess return of a factor, that it, the rewardfor holding an specific factor risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Beta\n",
    "\n",
    "The **beta** of an asset with respect to a factor is the sensitivity of the asset's expected excess return to the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We got those betas from the Linear Factor Decomposition (time-series regression) and we are using them to predict the expected excess return of the asset.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- A negative market beta mean that the asset is expected to have a lower return when the market goes up (negative mean excess return). Ex.: put options.\n",
    "- The betas are not typical time series regression betas (like in a Linear Factor Decomposition), because if they were, the equation E[r_i] = beta_i,m * E[r_m] would actually be E[r_t] = alpha + beta_m,t * E[r_m,t] + epsilon_t\n",
    "- Whatever happens this month (ex. stock goes down while the market goes up), it doesn't matter. This Factor Pricing Models are a theory about expected long-term average excess returns.\n",
    "- Different than Linear Factor Decomposition, where the the left and right hand side are about realized returns. Here we are talking about expected excess returns.\n",
    "    - In a Linear Factor Decomposition, the beats means that, on average, when the market goes up by 1%, the asset goes up by beta_i,m %.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market Beta:** The sensitivity of a stock's return to the market return.\n",
    "- **Size Beta:** The sensitivity of a stock's return to the size factor.\n",
    "- **Value Beta:** The sensitivity of a stock's return to the value factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get each of those betas by running a regression of the stock's return on the factors' return.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The factors don't have to have a trend over time if the market is trending over time, because they are hedged long-short portfolios: they could go up a lot or down a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "What matters is the security's **beta** matters, not its measure of the **characteristic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *The premium comes if the stock \"acts like\" the factor, not if the stock \"has\" the characteristic.*\n",
    "- So what does the FF model expect of a stock with high B/M yet low correlation to other high B/M stocks?\n",
    "- **Beta** earns premium—not the stock’s characteristic.\n",
    "- This is one difference between FF \"value\" investing and Buffett-Graham \"value\" investing.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Smart Beta ETFs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:**\n",
    "- A smart beta ETF is a type of exchange-traded fund that uses alternative index construction rules to traditional market capitalization-based indices.\n",
    "- The strategy is to use factor models to systematically select, weight, and rebalance stocks in the ETF to add value by tilting its exposure to specific risk premia.\n",
    "- Smart beta portfolios are constructed such that the emphasis is weighting stocks in these portfolios not on the traditional measure of market capitalization, but by incorporating into their weighting scheme some aspect of a security’s fundamental value, such as a stock’s B/M ratio, profitability, or a characteristic of the security’s performance, such as a stock’s momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart beta ETFs are considered a combination of passive and active investing:\n",
    "- They are **passive** because they passively mimic what are termed **factor indexes** and hence do not require any input from a portfolio manager.\n",
    "- They are **active** because their weights deviate from standard market capitalization weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Lower fees than active management and hedge funds.\n",
    "- Transparent and rules-based.\n",
    "- Diversified and liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- Do not capture the pure factors because ETFs are not allowed to short stocks, so the long-only portfolios end up having high correlation with the market (not \"near-zero\" market beta).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. CAPM\n",
    "\n",
    "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a linear factor model that relates the expected excess return of an asset to its beta with the market portfolio and the market risk premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAPM identifies the **market portfolio** as the tangency portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The market portfolio is the value-weighted portfolio of all available assets.\n",
    "- It should include every type of asset, including non-traded assets.\n",
    "- In practice, a broad equity index is typically used.\n",
    "- *In practice, we use a broad equity index, like SPY or Russell 1000.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAPM is about **expected** returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The expected return of any asset is given as a function of two market statistics: the risk-free rate and the market risk premium.\n",
    "- The coefficient is determined by a regression. \n",
    "- The theory does not say anything about how the risk-free rate or market risk premium are given: it is a **relative pricing formula**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Market beta is the only risk associated to higher average returns:*\n",
    "- No other characteristics of the asset command a higher expected excess return returns from investors\n",
    "- **Beyond how it affects market beta, CAPM says volatility, skewness, and other covariances do not matter** for determining risk premia.\n",
    "- Idiosyncratic risks have such a negligible effect on the portfolio that in the limit it becomes meaningless  (what matters is its covariance with the rest of the portfolio).\n",
    "- The only thing that matters is the beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Derivation of the CAPM\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First method: If returns have a joint normal distribution...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The mean and variance of returns are sufficient statistics for the return distribution.\n",
    "2. Thus, every investor holds a portfolio on the MV frontier.\n",
    "3. Everyone holds a combination of the tangency portfolio and the risk-free rate.\n",
    "4. Then aggregating across investors, the market portfolio of all investments is equal to the tangency portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "1. Returns are not jointly normal nor iid.\n",
    "2. Investors ae not each holding a portfolio on the MV frontier.\n",
    "3. Then. in reality, the market portfolio is not the tangency portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Method: Don’t assume the returns are jointly normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is another way of assuming all investors choose MV portfolios (only care about mean and variance of return).\n",
    "- But now it is not because mean and variance are sufficient statistics of the return distribution, but rather that they are sufficient statistics of investor objectives.\n",
    "- So one derivation of the CAPM is about return distribution, while the other is about investor behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "- Investors do not all hold MV portfolios, some could be holding inefficient portfolios based on their individual preferences or what makes them feel good.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Return Variance Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAPM implies a clear relation between volatility of returns and risk premia.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider the linear factor decomposition:\n",
    "$$\\tilde{r}_t^i = \\beta^{i,m} \\tilde{r}_t^m + \\epsilon_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take the variance of both sides of the equation to get:\n",
    "$$\\sigma_i^2 = (\\beta^{i,m})^2 (\\sigma^m)^2 + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2$$\n",
    "$$\\sigma_i^2 = sistemaic + idiosyncratic$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So CAPM implies...\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variance of an asset’s return is made up of a systematic (or market) portion and an idiosyncratic portion --> *Only the former risk is priced.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Proportional Risk Premium\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAPM implies that the risk premium of an asset is proportional to the risk premium of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\tilde{r}^i \\right] = \\beta^{i,m} \\, \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\tilde{r}^m \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the definition of \\( \\beta^{i,m} \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\tilde{r}^i \\right]}{\\sigma^i} = \\left( \\rho^{i,m} \\right) \\frac{\\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\tilde{r}^m \\right]}{\\sigma^m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The CAPM and Sharpe Ratio:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the definition of the Sharpe ratio in (3), we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{SR}^i = \\left( \\rho^{i,m} \\right) \\text{SR}^m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Sharpe ratio earned on an asset depends only on the correlation between the asset return and the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A security with large idiosyncratic risk, $( \\sigma_\\epsilon^2 )$, will have lower $( \\rho^{i,m} )$, which implies a lower Sharpe Ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *If there is a factor (or combination of factors) such that it has the highest sharpe ratio, then this factor (or this combination of factors) is the tangency portfolio.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- The math shows that all assets have a sharpe ration smaller or equal to the market sharpe ratio (because correlation is between -1 and 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus, risk premia are determined only by systematic risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "*All securities must have a Sharpe ratio smaller than the market Sharpe ratio (which returns to the idea that market portfolio is the tangency portfolio).*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The CAPM and Treynor Ratio:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Treynor Ratio} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\tilde{r}^i \\right]}{\\beta^{i,m}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- If CAPM does not hold, then Treynor’s Measure is not capturing all priced risk.\n",
    "- If the CAPM does hold, then: *Treynor Ratio should be equal to all securities = market portfolio risk premium.*\n",
    "- If we calculated the tangency portfolio using MV and expected returns for each asset by its mean return, and use that portfolio as the market portfolio, then the Treynor Ratio would be the same for all assets.\n",
    "    - But we cannot do that because we don't know the expected returns of the assets - and that's exactly what we are trying to find out.\n",

    "### 2.4. CAPM as Practical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For many years, the CAPM was the primary model in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In many early tests, it performed quite well.\n",
    "- Some statistical error could be attributed to difficulties in testing.\n",
    "- For instance, the market return in the CAPM refers to the return on all assets—not just an equity index (*Roll critique*): you can't disproved the CAPM by using an equity index because you never used the true market portfolio.\n",
    "- Further, working with short series of volatile returns leads to considerable statistical uncertainty.\n",

    "\n",
    "Different investors can measure value in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Fama and French, the **book-to-market (B/M) ratio** is the market value of equity divided by the book (balance sheet) value of equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- High B/M means strong (accounting) fundamentals per market-value-dollar.\n",
    "- High B/M are **value stocks**.\n",
    "- Low B/M are **growth stocks**.\n",

    "*Low*: < 30% percentile  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Other Value Measures:**\n",
    "Many other measures of value are based on some cash-flow or accounting value per market price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Earnings-price** is a popular metric beyond value portfolios. Like B/M, the E/P ratio is accounting value per market valuation.\n",
    "- **EBITDA-price** is similar, but uses an accounting measure of profit that ignores taxes, financing, and depreciation.\n",
    "- **Dividend-price** uses common dividends, but is less useful for individual firms as many have no dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other measures exist, with competing claims to being a special/better measure of \"value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.1. Value vs. Growth Stocks:\n",
    "The labels \"growth\" and \"value\" are widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historically, value stocks have delivered higher average returns.\n",
    "- So-called \"value\" investors try to take advantage of this by looking for stocks with low market price per fundamental or per cash-flow.\n",
    "- Much research has been done to try to explain this difference of returns and whether it is reflective of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth Stocks:**\n",
    "Stocks trading at a low price relative to a measure of fundamental value such as book equity.\n",
    "- It doesn't mean they have actually grown a lot in the past. It means that it doesn't have much accounting value per stock.\n",
    "- The name comes from the implication that investors must be expecting the company to grow a lot in the future to justify paying a high price for the stock relative to its book value (low book to market ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value Stocks:**\n",
    "- High book-to-market ratio companies are generally less profitable and are relatively distressed, so these firms are riskier and have a higher average return.\n",
