    "## Risk Premia Across Assets\n",
    "\n",
    "The **risk premium** of an asset, $i$, is defined as the **expected excess return**:  \n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E} [\\tilde{r}^i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Linear Factor Models (LFMs):**  \n",
    "  LFMs describe how risk premia vary across assets.\n",
    "- Variation in risk premia is often attributed to differences in risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## CAPM: An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CAPM** states that risk premia across assets $i$ are:  \n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E} [\\tilde{r}^i] = (\\beta^{i,m}) \\lambda_m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights:\n",
    "- Risk premia are proportional (by beta) to the market risk premium.\n",
    "- Beta and risk premia are often estimated as **stationary time series averages** and do not condition on time.\n",

    "## Risk Premia Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "How do risk premia evolve over time?  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}_t [\\tilde{r}^i_{t+1}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Possibilities:\n",
    "1. **Time-Invariant Risk Premium:**  \n",
    "   The expected excess return remains constant:  \n",
    "   $$\\mathbb{E}_t [\\tilde{r}^i_{t+1}] = \\mathbb{E} [\\tilde{r}^i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time-Varying Risk Premium:**  \n",
    "   Risk premium depends on time-varying factors, $x_t$:  \n",
    "   $$\\mathbb{E}_t [\\tilde{r}^i_{t+1}] = f(x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling Time-Varying Risk Premia\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture time variation, we specify a functional form for $f(x)$:  \n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}_t [\\tilde{r}^i_{t+1}] = f(x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Steps for Modeling:*\n",
    "1. Identify the relevant factors, $x_t$.\n",
    "2. Use a **linear function** for simplicity:\n",
    "   - Linear regression provides the best linear estimator of $f(x)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The conditional expectation of $y$ given $x$:  \n",
    "  $$\\mathbb{E}[y \\mid x] = \\alpha + \\beta x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $\\beta \\neq 0$, the conditional expectation varies with $x$.\n",

    "## Forecasting Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "A **forecasting regression** for returns:  \n",
    "$$\\tilde{r}_{t+1} = \\alpha + \\beta x_t + \\epsilon_{t+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Implications:\n",
    "- If $\\beta \\neq 0$, expected returns vary over time as $x_t$ changes:  \n",
    "  $$\\mathbb{E} [\\tilde{r}_{t+1} \\mid x_t] = \\alpha + \\beta x_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar regressions are used in LFMs to explore risk premia variations across assets.\n",

    "**Motivations for Forecasting:**\n",
    "- Economic cycles.\n",
    "- Valuation metrics.\n",

    "## Classic View of Risk Premia\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions:\n",
    "- **Risk premia are constant over time.**\n",
    "- Returns follow a **random walk** (with drift):  \n",
    "  $$\\log P_{t+1} - \\log P_t = \\text{constant} + \\epsilon_{t+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications:\n",
    "- Forecasting regressions yield $\\beta = 0$.\n",
    "- Price changes are unpredictable:  \n",
    "  $$\\mathbb{E}_t \\left[\\frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t}\\right] = \\text{constant}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing the Classic View\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the classic view, regress today’s return on tomorrow’s return:  \n",
    "$$\\tilde{r}^m_{t+1} = a + \\beta \\tilde{r}^m_t + \\epsilon_{t+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results:\n",
    "- Coefficients near zero align with the classic view.\n",
    "- Implication: High returns today do not predict future returns.\n",

    "## Dividend-Yield Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dividend-yield** (DP) is defined as:  \n",
    "$$\\text{DP}_t = \\frac{D_t}{P_t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other measures include earnings-price and book-price ratios.\n",
    "- Works well for market indices due to continuous dividend streams.\n",

    "Expanded:  \n",

    "### Modern View of Dividend-Yield\n",
    "\n",
    "**Empirical Observations:**\n",
    "- Higher dividend-yield predicts higher expected returns:  \n",
    "  $$\\mathbb{E}_t [R_{t,t+k}] = \\text{DP}_t \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_t \\left[ \\frac{D_{t+k}}{D_t} \\right] + \\mathbb{E}_t \\left[ \\frac{P_{t+k}}{P_t} \\right]$$\n",

    "#### Long-Horizon Predictability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Empirical Observations:**\n",
    "- Predictability by DP is evident in **long horizons** due to DP’s persistence.\n",
    "- Regression:  \n",

    "## Statistical Concerns in Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges:\n",
    "1. High persistence in variables like DP introduces **bias** in regression.\n",
    "2. Errors grow over time, inflating $t$-statistics.\n",
