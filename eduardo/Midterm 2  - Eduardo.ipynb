    "Time diversification is the idea that, over long horizons, the mean annualized return stabilizes as its variance declines. It follows the idea of the law of large numbers, which states that the more independent and identically distributed random variables we have, the more the sample average converges to the true mean. This means that, over long horizons, the mean annualized return converges to the true mean return, which makes the annual mean returns less risky (more confident they will be closer to the true population value).\n",
